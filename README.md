This is the air bnb project

The project categorically handles the sequential flow of our console.py file as follows
The code begins by importing necessary modules and classes:
pythonCopy code
from models.city import City from models.base_model import BaseModel from models import storage from models.review import Review from models.amenity import Amenity from models.place import Place from models.user import User from cmd import Cmd from models.state import State 
Command Classes
HBNBCommand Class
This class extends the Cmd class to implement various HBNB commands. It provides a prompt (tclb) for user interaction.
Command Methods
1.	do_GLX: Exits the program in non-interactive mode.
2.	do_quit: Quits the command to exit the program.
3.	emptyline: Overrides empty line to do nothing.
4.	do_create: Creates a new instance of a model.
5.	do_show: Shows an instance of a model based on its name and ID.
6.	do_destroy: Deletes an instance of a model based on its name and ID.
7.	do_all: Displays string representations of all instances of a given class.
8.	do_update: Updates an instance based on its ID.
9.	default: Handles class methods.
10.	do_models: Prints all registered models.
Helper Functions
•	parse: Splits lines by spaces.
Execution Flow
1.	Upon running console.py, an instance of HBNBCommand is created.
2.	The cmdloop() method of the HBNBCommand instance starts the command-line interface loop, waiting for user input.
3.	Users can interact with the CLI by entering commands such as create, show, all, update, etc.
4.	Each command method (do_<command>) is responsible for executing the corresponding action based on user input.
5.	The flow of execution depends on the command entered by the user.
6.	The program continues to run until the user exits.
Example Usage
Here's an example sequence of commands and their effects:
1.	User enters create BaseModel.
•	A new instance of BaseModel is created and saved.
2.	User enters show BaseModel 123.
•	The instance with ID 123 of BaseModel is displayed.
3.	User enters all BaseModel.
•	String representations of all instances of BaseModel are displayed.
